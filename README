bittorrent client

a very naive (currently) bittorrent client. starts threads for individual peers when necessary,
for example when reading messages, downloading/uploading data.
it is very easily crashable by malicious clients/messages. but as peers' messages are always handled inside threads
the panics/crashes don't propagate thus allowing the client to run somewhat smoothly.

supported beps:

- udp trackers https://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html
  no ipv6
- multitrackers https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0012.html
  tiers are not respected

todo:

- server accept connections
- magnet links
- http trackers
- verify HAVE messages, blacklist and choke
- endgame mode
